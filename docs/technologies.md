# Front-End UI:
- Sass & Bootstrap 
- React (new to me, learning now)

## Back-End:

    - Python & Django I think are a better fit for this project even though I have more experience with Node.js
    - Django has a built-in scheduler
- Server: 
    - Python & Django
- Database: 
    - Django uses SQLite by default
- API: 
    - Django REST
